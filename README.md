### Hi there and welcome! 👋

Danish software developer here. After completing my M.Sc. in Communications and working in hospitality for a decade, COVID-19 struck, and I decided it was time to seek out new adventures. Following a lifelong dream of working in and with tech, I signed up for an AP degree in Computer Science in the summer of 2020. I've been having a blast since and am currently working at a major insurance company in Copenhagen.
