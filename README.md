### Hi there and welcome!

Danish software developer here. After completing my Ms.S in communications and working in hospitality for a decade, Corona struck and I decided it perhaps was time to seek out new adventures. Following a lifelong dream of working in and with IT, I signed up for an AP degree in Computer Science in the summer of 2020, and been having a blast since, and just landed my first job at https://www.nnit.com/da/ after commpleting my degree in february.
